cmin = changed within the mins 
mindepth 3 = go down 3 dirs
maxdepth 2 = goes up
## sort
  sort                sorts content according to position on the ASCII table
  sort -o             output to a differnet file
  sort -n             sorts content numerically
  sort -u             sorts content uniqely
  sort -nr            sorts content numerically reversed
  sort -t +
  sort -k 2,4         sorts 1st by content in the 2nd column, then by content in the 4th column
## cut
  -d delimiter
  -f fields
  -c characters
  -s only delimiter
  --output-delimiter
  cut -d: -f1         displays only portion of line before 1st instance of delimiter ``:''
  cut -d: -f1-        " and any following strings up to the very next instance ``:''
  cut -d: -f1- -s     " " but donâ€™t print any lines not containing delimiter ``:''
  cut -f3             displays only the 3rd field delimited by space
  cut -f2-4           displays only fields 2 through 4 delimited by space
  cut -c3-10          displays only the 3rd through 10th characters of each line
## awk
  awk -F: '{print $1}'         displays 1st field delimited by a ":"
  awk '{print $2}'             displays 2nd field, delimited automatically by whitespace
  awk '{print $0}'             displays all string data that matches

  awk -F: '($3 == 0) {print $1}' /etc/passwd
                              displays 1st field (username) IF the 3rd field (UID) is equal to "0"
  awk '{print $NF}'           displays only the last field of every line
    $0 prints entire line
    NR shows line number


history = shows hidtory with numbers
  ! = run line number
  !! = runs last command
  
man = manull
  man bash = bash help page
  / = search
  q = quit
  egrep = looks for pathern
  G = moves to the end
  g = moves to the start
